### Hi. I'm Reeka. :wave:
I pride myself on being a hard worker and will always take the opportunity to learn. I enjoy taking on challenging projects and learning to work in new environments.

I had a short career in Civil Engineering before I decided to take a step back to re-evaluate my life goals. I took some time to volunteer with non-profits, substitute for my public school district, become a support group leader and start a small art business. Through each option, there was a connecting factor. The importance of software development. I saw gaps that could be filled with the right software application.

I have a passion for back-end, I enjoy the technical side of all things and have naturally gravitated towards server-side development.
